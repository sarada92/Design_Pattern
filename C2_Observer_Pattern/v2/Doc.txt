Drawback of update function with all possible Attributes of the Subject is mitigated.
Only required Attribute's get method is called to fetch the changed data

But at the same time we need to make tight coupling with WeatherData.

What if implementing getter and setter for Temperature, Humidity & Pressure in Subject interface?
    As we expect more subject type implementation
    So for few Temperature, Humidity, Pressure does not relate
