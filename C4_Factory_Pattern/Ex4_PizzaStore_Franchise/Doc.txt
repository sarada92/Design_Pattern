Now, We have franchised our Pizza. But nonetheless we are using the same dough, sauce in
different states for making Pizza.

Thought:
But, after someday people complains about the unique nature of pizza that mark NewYork on the top spot
As we are promoting/delivering the same style of pizza in both New York and Chicago, people are not happy
with our recipe.


We need to be flexible in pizza preparation, baking, topping, packaging & Cutting.
And let the local vendor to customize as per the local customer demands.

Let's create Ny Style CheesePizza, MushroomPizza
similarly Chicago Style Pizza

Important:
We are not using any factory method, we have created two Separate PizzaStore classed to handle object creation
