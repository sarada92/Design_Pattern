A simple extension to previous design.
    - We have added two new Factory class
            - New York
            - Chicago
You can now open HangOut Pizza in different states.
Drawback:
We are keeping the recipe same for all states.

Thought:
But, after someday people complains about the unique nature of pizza that mark NewYork on the top spot
As we are promoting/delivering the same style of pizza in both New York and Chicago, people are not happy
with our recipe.


We need to be flexible in pizza preparation, baking, topping, packaging & Cutting.
And let the local vendor to customize as per the local customer demands.
