When to use what?
Here are some examples when inheritance or delegation are being used:
Assume your class is called B and the derived/delegated to class is called A then If

    You want to express relationship (is-a) then you want to use Inheritance.
    You want to be able to pass your class to an existing API expecting Aâ€™s then you need to use inheritance.
    You want to enhance A, but A is final and can no further be sub-classed then you need to use composition and delegation
